# FM26 history sections: reverse-engineering notes

Working notes for decoding the ~55 section types fmsave 0.5.8 does not yet read.
Ground truth: a real career save (`Karl Hudgell - UnemployedNew.fm`, build 26.3.2+2329565)
that started as an FM24 save imported into FM26, in-game date 2037-12-04, one club
(St. Albans City, save club uid 716, database unique_id 717).

## Section header grammar

Every history section opens with `03 01 <4-char type tag>` (`tmc.` or `tad.` at least
so far), then tag/version-specific header words. fmsave does not parse these tags
(`_container.py` only opens the container itself, magic `02 01 'fmf.'`); the history
readers we write own this grammar.

## Decoded so far

### comp_history_dt — LAYOUT CRACKED (55-byte uniform rows)

File = `tmc.` header (52 B) + rows + tail. On the ground-truth save: 82,800 rows.

**Header (52 B):**
```
03 01 'tmc.' 03 00        (8 B)
u32 0
u32 0x768  = 1896         (earliest season in the table?)
u32 0xd6   = 214
u32 0xde   = 222
u32 0x1ab0d = 109,069
ff * 24                   (24 sentinel bytes, 6 x u32 -1)
```

**Rows:** stride is 55 B, but block start offsets VARY between regions of the file —
the section is a stream of variable-length groups, and within a group every row is
uniformly 55 B (one group showed 82,351 consecutive 55-gap record starts). A row:

```
[u16 y_a] [u16 y_b] [u16 small] [u16 y4]         8 B
[u32] * 11 slots                                44 B
[3-byte marker] [n] [type] [00]                  3 B   = LEAD of the NEXT record
```

Two record shapes, distinguished by the type byte in the 3-byte marker:

- **type 04** — league season rows (slot0+ = competition id / club list):
  e.g. season 1993/94: `12 | 1995 | 736 715 716 | ff...` (comp id 12, then clubs).
  The `xx 04 00` marker precedes each league row; 50,339 rows end in `00 04 00`.
- **type 02** — club/chain rows (club uid in slot 0):
  e.g. `716 | 2020 | 3486 | 263` (club 716, prev-year 2020, two reference ids).
  The u32s in slots 2-3 chain seasons (9498 and 4312 recur across rows as
  prev/next links); 22,317 type-02 candidate records found.

**St. Albans club-league block** (contiguous, offset 0x1340f2, ~30 rows, type 02):
covers seasons 1991 → 2021/22 and then stops — exactly matching the ground truth
that after the FM24→FM26 import the manager-history screens say "data only valid
from 26/12/2024". So comp_history_dt holds the pre-import (originally FM24) season
chain, and post-import seasons must live in other sections — the search target for
the 2023/24 onward league rows.

The u16 y_a/y_b pairs in the block: single-season rows show y_a==y_b (e.g.
2021/2021), multi-year spans show (1975,1976), (1977,1978), (1993,1994),
(1995,1996), (2018,2019) — so the pair is a spell start/end, not per-season rows.

### tc_manager_history_dt (tmc., 799,746 B, header count field 0x1f30 = 7,984)
- Header: `03 01 'tmc.' 02 00 30 1f 00 00 01 00`, records follow (12-byte header).
- Year words are u16 LE right in the data (e.g. `e6 07` = 2022, `98 00` = day 152
  ≈ June 1, `b6 00` = 182 ≈ July 1 — season start dates).
- 8 bytes of `0xff` (-1 sentinels) inside records: unset end refs.
- Exactly ONE u32 literal of our club uid (716) in the whole file => one record per
  managed spell. The spell row sits around offset 0x36c4:
  `00 0a 00 00 00 00 | cc 02 00 00 | b6 00 | e7 07 | 4e 6f | e7 07 | ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff`
  i.e. something(0x0a), club_uid(716), day 182, year 2023, ..., followed by small u16
  fields `05 00 06 00 08 00 02 00` and further u32s (`b9 4a 00 00`, `ce 3b 00 00`, ...).
- Year-word frequency 2022..2037 ≈ 3,000-4,000 records/year → rows for every managed
  spell per manager per season, whole game world.

### tc_cup_history_dt
- Repeating 16-byte campaign rows:
  `<u32 club_or_comp_id> <u16 start_year> <u16 end_year> <u16> <u32> <u32 club_uid>`
  e.g. `4d 15 00 00 e8 07 e9 07 02 01 ff ff ff 00` (year pair 2024/2025)
  with St. Albans (716) as one of the two clubs — 20 rows = 14ish seasons of entries.

### tc_record_man (tad., 22,737,139 B)
- Header: `03 01 'tad.' 18 00 | u32 5 | ff * 24 | u32 22 | u32 ... | u32 6 ...`
- Body is a stream of small records with a repeating 17-byte unit:
  `03 00 00 00 | 00 | 01 00 | 6c 07 | 01 00 | 6c 07 | 00 00 00 00`
  (u32 = 3, then u16 pairs where 1900 = the null-year sentinel from comp_history).
- u32 payloads (record ids like 2593, 3486) appear as bytes only ~100-183 times each
  across 22.7 MB — u16 collision-level noise, so they are NOT raw literals there;
  likely indexes into offset-sized arrays or reconstructed at load.
- Structure probe ongoing: looks like a "man" container with several sub-arrays.

### award_year_hist_dt
- Rows keyed on club uid 716 (29 hits) with small u32s after
  (`15 00 00 00`, `19 00 00 00` = 21, 25 — award index / year offset pairs).

### hall_of_fame
- Records reference a person (0x2fd = 765) + club 716 + flag bytes — 4 St. Albans rows.

## Method notes
- Names live in `game_db`; history sections reference people/clubs by uid (u32 LE),
  often with the doubled/sound-header encoding fmsave uses for persons.
- `fmsave.open(save)._read_section(name)` gives the decompressed bytes — good enough
  for analysis; extracted copies in analysis workdir are not committed.
- For FM24-imported careers: game_db carries duplicated player records (old + new copy);
  see `src/fmsave/readers/player_scan.py` dedup fork (keep the latest copy, warn).
- `scripts/decode_comp_history.py` walks comp_history_dt rows (stride 55 from offset 55)
  and prints rows matching a club uid.
- FM24-import artefact boundary: club season chains end at season 2021/22; anything
  decoded for later seasons must come from other sections (tc_*_history / manager history).
