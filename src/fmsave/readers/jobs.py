"""Reading the open vacancies out of the `job_centre` section.

The records are back to back, so nothing is searched for: the count in the header says how
many there are and the walk reads them in order, each sized by the id count it stores itself.
What guards that walk is the section's own size, because the records the header claims have
to end exactly where the section does. That identity is the only check a start shifted by a
whole record fails: every per-record test then passes, on the next record's bytes.

Every field of a record comes from the layout, and the two dates are decoded with the scan's
own date reader, which masks the time-of-day bits these dates carry.
