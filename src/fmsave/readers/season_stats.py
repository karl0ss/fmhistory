"""The season-statistics section: one record per player, walked end to end.

The section is one frame of the span region, which the directory does not list. It is found by
reading only the head of each frame there: the frames whose body starts with the section header
and the layout's schema are the candidates, and exactly one of them must walk end to end, from
its first record to the zero that ends the list and a footer ending the frame. Every record is
read by its own structure rather than searched for, so a byte out of place anywhere fails the
walk instead of shifting what later records read.

A record is keyed by the player's pindex plus one and holds a line per kind of match for the
player's own team, the same lines for each other team the player turned out for this season, and two
calendar-year lines. The walk keeps each line's offset; the lines are decoded only when rows are
built, which reads every field of a line with one struct.
