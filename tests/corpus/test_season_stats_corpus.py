"""Corpus checks for Save.player_season_stats. Output never includes real save content.

Values read from a save never appear in an assert or a message: each check reduces to a
boolean, and failures are reported by file name and field name only.

The screen checks compare every figure the owner's screenshots recorded (squad statistics
screens and player profile panels, transcribed into the recorded values) with the rows the reader
returns for the save each screenshot was paired with. Those saves are live copies kept beside
the manifest's two, so a check whose save is not present is skipped rather than failed.
